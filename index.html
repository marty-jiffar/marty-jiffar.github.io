                <p>Inspired by my first salmon season in Alaska last summer. It is a predictive model that uses previous years' ex-vessel salmon prices and economic data from the United States and Japan (where a large portion of Alaskan salmon is sold) to estimate an answer to a question on every fisherman's mind: what's the price per pound this season?</p>

                <p id = "p1">I am a fourth-year at the University of Chicago, majoring in statistics and minoring in computer science. I have a wide variety of experience including student government, research in a population genetics lab, journalism, and extensive coursework in STEM. I really enjoy learning new skills and working collaboratively to solve tough problems. </p>
            <br>
            <p id="p2">When I tell people I study statistics they often look at me with pity, but I like explaining that I am deeply passionate about the field. With big data and modern technology, we have more information than ever before about phenomena outside our immediate experience. However, without certain skills, this information can be overwhelming and even meaningless &mdash; statistics and computer science equip us to make sense of it all.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="p3">I also appreciate statistics in a more philosophical sense. Sure, "the median is the message," but at the same time every individual datum scattered around the median has its own authentic narrative. I try to maintain a balance between thinking about trends and the individuals who comprise the trend, whether studying history or biology or politics etc. I don't think that seeing life through a quantitative lens is mutually exclusive with seeing it through an empathetic one. Quite to the contrary, data analysis can help you understand people's experiences that you may never have been exposed to otherwise.</p>
